# Session Handoff

## Trajectory & Context
* Investigated blocked video embedding on `https://www.petersgasse.at`. Confirmed that SharePoint Online returns `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` and CSP `frame-ancestors` restricting iframe embeds to Microsoft internal domains, accompanied by 403 Forbidden for unauthenticated visitors.
* Tested updated embed parameters (`ust: true`) via curl against `petersgasse-my.sharepoint.com` and confirmed the same framing restrictions and authentication requirement remain active on Microsoft's end.
* Removed the embedded video from `content/de/_index.md` per user request and cleaned up associated CSS rules.
* Resolved mobile horizontal viewport overflow by applying universal `box-sizing: border-box`, overflow clipping, responsive rules for media/tables, and properly pinning `.header` with right margin on `.navbar-burger`.
* Resolved persistent navigation dropdowns by overriding `anatole-header.js` with mutual exclusivity between dropdowns, click-outside detection, Escape key dismissal, and link-click closure.

* Resolved Hugo v0.158+ deprecation warnings: updated `languageCode` to `locale` and `languages.de.languageName` to `label` in `config/_default/hugo.toml`, and resolved template deprecations (`.Language.Direction` and `.Site.Language.Locale`) across layout overrides (`baseof.html`, `head.html`, `schema.html`, `rss.xml`).
* Cleaned 45 orphaned artifacts from `public/` (old school year PDFs, deprecated CSS/JS hash bundles, deleted pages) and configured `cleanDestinationDir = true` in `config/_default/hugo.toml` to automatically purge stale files on all subsequent builds.

## Current State
* Local `public/` directory contains strictly current build files (283 files).
* Hugo build executes cleanly with zero warnings or errors.
